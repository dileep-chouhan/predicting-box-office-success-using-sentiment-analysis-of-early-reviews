# Predicting Box Office Success Using Sentiment Analysis of Early Reviews

**Overview:**

This project aims to develop a predictive model for box office success based on sentiment analysis of early movie reviews.  By analyzing the sentiment expressed in reviews gathered before a film's official release, we aim to create a model that can help studios optimize marketing spend and mitigate financial risk associated with new releases. The analysis involves collecting review data, performing sentiment analysis, and building a predictive model to correlate sentiment with final box office revenue.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* NLTK (or other NLP library - specify if different)
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.  Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Script:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

**Example Output:**

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details about the sentiment analysis, model training performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, R-squared), and potentially model predictions on a test dataset. Additionally, the script will generate several visualization files (e.g., `sentiment_distribution.png`, `model_performance.png`) which will be saved in the project directory. These plots will visualize the distribution of sentiment scores and the performance of the predictive model.  Specific output details are dependent on the data used and the model trained.

**Data:**
